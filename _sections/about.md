##### <strong><em>How does the cell leverage chemical complexity on RNA to control gene expression?</em>
Organisms across all domains of life decorate their RNA molecules with an incredible diversity of chemical modifications. Modifications on mRNA and tRNA are critical for their function, affecting RNA structure, stability, and translational properties. Many of the proteins and enzymes that read, write, and erase these modifications are closely tied to human diseases ranging from neurological disorders to cancer to type 2 diabetes. While these proteins and pathways could be targets to treat these diseases, we lack a high-resolution, mechanistic understanding of how the cell installs, recognizes, and leverages chemical modifications on RNA. <strong>Our lab is working to understand how protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions regulate chemical modifications on RNA to control gene expression and impact human disease.</strong>

##### <strong><em>How do we monitor diverse, dynamic changes to RNA in the cell?</em> 
The cellular transcriptome is constantly in flux. New RNA molecules are rapidly synthesized, modified, translated, and degraded to control protein expression and respond to changes in cell environment and stress. Directly monitoring these changes in RNA composition, stability, and localization remains extremely challenging. <strong>Our lab is developing new tools to detect, map, and visualize the dynamic life of RNA inside the cell.</strong>
