##### <strong>Join our team!</strong>
We're looking for curious, enthusiastic scientists with interests in biochemistry, structural biology, chemical biology, and biophysics. Students in our lab learn and use a broad range of techniques including protein expression and purification, enzymology, RNA biochemistry, cell culture, macromolecular X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and other biophysical assays.
<br><br>

The Mugridge lab is actively recruiting at all levels! We have openings for <strong><i> graduate students </i></strong> in Chemistry & Biochemistry or other programs with interests at the interface of chemistry and biology, <strong><i> undergrads </i></strong> at UD interested in doing research during the academic year and over the Summer, and <strong><i> postdoctoral researchers </i></strong> with strong backgrounds in biochemistry or structural biology. <a href="mailto: mugridge@udel.edu">Contact Jeff </a> directly for more information.
<br><br>

##### <strong> Our values</strong>
The Mugridge lab is committed to creating a diverse, inclusive lab space where students and researchers of all backgrounds are welcomed and supported to grow and succeed as scientists. We will actively foster a dynamic, collaborative, and open lab environment where members feel free to ask challenging questions, do innovative science, and have fun doing it!
